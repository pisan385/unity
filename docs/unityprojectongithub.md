# Unity Project On GitHub

We need a web site to put our Unity projects, so we can play them via the web browser

1. Create a GitHub account https://github.com/

2. Download Github Desktop https://desktop.github.com/ 
You can use command line for GitHub, but the graphical desktop is easier to use

3. Follow the instructions on https://pages.github.com/ to create a **Project Site**

4. Use GitHub Desktop to pull (or clone) the new repository you created.

5. Create a webGL build for your Unity project. Move the directory 

2. Repositories need to be created for each project by either the students or staff.
3. Repositories should include the default unity ‘gitignore’ file, or a customized ‘gitignore’
file.
4. Students need to install git and a git client (if not using the command prompt). Github
desktop includes a mac and windows version of the client.
5. Students can then either clone the github repository or add a local repository.
6. Students then create a new unity project in the directory where the repository was cloned.
7. Upon project creation, students need to open the Edit window > Editor > Version Control
and have ‘Visible Meta Files’ enabled. In the same directory, students should have Asset
Serialization set to ‘Force Text’.
8. Students can then commit and push these changes.
9. An example unity upload onto Github can be found here:
